# hello-world
 Hello Coders:

I'm a self-taught computer programmer, web designer, and entrepeneur based in Philadelphia
I am currently in the beginning stages of becoming a computer programmer. I had been a student at Temple university studying both criminal justice and psychology for two years when I realized. I understood that I wanted a change in my life, that I wanted to do something that I would enjoy for the rest of my life. Something that I could be good at and love doing at the same time. Pursuing computer programing is just that for me. I intend to work hard every single day and have an amazing time doing it.

As stated before I am in the beginning stages of pursuing this, that being said I clearly lack experience. I have been and will continue to use resources such as freecodecamp.org, codepen, etc. As of right now I am the humble assist at Tavern on the Hill in Chestnut hill, PA. That being said I intend to and have been learning and coding every day. I will update this page when I acquire more experience and knowledge.
